# Beyond Ruby w/ Effect Systems

This is a sandbox and code for my talk on why I like Scala and Effect Systems.

## Development

This project uses `nix-shell` to make things more excellent and reproducible.

```bash
nix-shell ~/shell.nix
```

### Environment

The code depends on given environment variables:

- `POSITIONSTACK_API_KEY` - that can be obtained from [positionstack](https://positionstack.com).
- `OPENROUTE_API_KEY` - that can be obtained at [openroute service](https://openrouteservice.org).
- `PROMINFO_QUERY_ENDPOINT` that can be obtained upon request.
